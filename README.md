# robust_public_transport
using graph theory to automate the rerouting of the St Lucia bus network in the case of flooding. The current model contains Latitude, Longitude and elevation data of several bus routes and nearby roads. Various graph theory principles are used to automatically reroute buses.

to run the basic simulation, run
* python main.py

to run the extended simluation, run
* python main.py --disaster_resistant


keep an eye on the terminal output, as it will ask for confirmation before the simulation starts.
