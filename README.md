# robust_public_transport
using graph theory to similate a robust public transport network

to run the basic simulation, run
  [] python main.py

to run the extended simluation, run
  [] python main.py --disaster_resistant


keep an eye on the terminal output, as it will ask for confirmation before the simulation starts.
